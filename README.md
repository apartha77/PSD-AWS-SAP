# PSD-AWS-SAP
I have create the repository for the selected AWS topics, which I read duirng my AWS SAP certification. These are from various different sources, AWS Rampup Guide, AWS Documents, Adrian Cantrill's course (https://learn.cantrill.io.), Tutorialsdojo (https://tutorialsdojo.com/) etc. I would suggest, if you wan to learn quickly, then buy the course directly to get the original and latest contents.
